                            <p style="line-height: 150%; text-align: center"><b>I started my adult career path working in a distribution center that focused solely on
                                the distribution of frozen goods, ice-cream to be specific. While working at this company,
                                Transcold distribution, I learned how to operate multiple types of machinery such as 
                                a Counter-balance Forklift, Reach Truck, and Electric Walkie. As I moved through the company
                                I learned a variety of topics which ranged from shipping/receiving to things such as routing.
                                <br><br>
                                Though my passion doesn't belong to distribution or logistics but rather software developement
                                and coding, more specifically web developement and game developement. I grew up amazed by
                                the worlds of Pokemon, Final Fantasy, and many more. Escaping to these games as the rain trickled
                                down outside, I grew to love these worlds, these characters, and these stories. As I grew older
                                I continued to enjoy these games and the worlds they created and ultimately found myself creating
                                an online editorial website to write reviews of these games, using wordpress as my platform. The website
                                and websites I created in my teens were based off of templates that I found, but I slowly begun to learn 
                                design principles that have stuck with me to this day, not to mention some pretty snazzy graphic design skills!
                                <br><br>
                                As an adult I went astray from these passions of mine, supplementing them with the odd website tinkering and gaming
                                on the weekend but I made the decision to attend univerisity in the fall of 2021, starting my first class at BCIT in 
                                January of 2022. With a focus on technology and programming, I'm taking the Computer Systems Certificate that'll
                                give me the entry requirements I need to eventually apply for BCIT's CompSci Bachelor program.
