# Personal-Site - Resume-Concept
A personal website I created in university using my resume as the concept behind it, focusing solely on HTML and CSS for the creation and using a minor portion of Javascript to create a drop down menu which is called by media queries
I'm planning to continue to work on it and add upon it while I learn more JavaScript and eventually React.JS
